# Warehouse Data Structures and API
#### *Engineer technical interview test 0001*

# Overview
The Warehouse Management System includes classes and methods to handle the logic of material storage, movement, and observation. It supports multiple warehouses, each containing various materials with quantities. The system provides functionalities such as adding, removing, and transferring materials between warehouses.

# Testing Approach
To ensure the reliability and correctness of the system, I adopted a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. I've written JUnit tests for essential classes, validating their functionalities and behavior under different scenarios. However, due to time constraints, tests are currently available only for two classes.
